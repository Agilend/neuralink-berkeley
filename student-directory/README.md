in less than 60 seconds

you will learn how to contribute to Open Source

with your first Pull Request.

Nowadays, the go-to platform is GitHub

so make sure to have an account.

**Create an account**

You can create one real quick.

Find the repository you want to contribute at.

I posted an entire video on this topic,  you can check it out on my channel.

Scroll through the issues, you  should find some with labels

**Write a comment**

Good First Issue or Help Wanted

They're usually the best to begin

Let everyone know you're gonna work  on that issue by writing a comment.

You now need a Fork of the repository.

**Create a fork**

You can create one with the  button on the top right corner.

Clone your fork locally, do  your changes in a new branch

and push them back to the original repo.

You will now see a button to  create a Pull Request, click on it.

Fill in the additional details and it's done!

Now let's wait for the  maintainers to approve a merge.

Properly contributing to Open Source takes  way more time, passion and dedication.

Pressing buttons on GitHub is the easy part.
